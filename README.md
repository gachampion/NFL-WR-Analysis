# NFL WR Analysis
Final Project for Data Engineering Course from Masters of Science in Analytics Program 

Executive Summary:
Each year, hundreds of new players enter the NFL draft with the hopes of becoming the next league MVP.  Because college players entering the draft could have unique backgrounds in terms of team, conference, schedule, etc., the NFL combine is held each spring before the draft to standardize metrics related to player athletic ability. This project will analyze these metrics historically to gauge the accuracy of combine results & draft position on the impact the players have made in the NFL. 

Business Case:
A lot of pressure rides on NFL team owners & coaches to select the right player at the right time in the draft.  Therefore, they need to understand how performance in the NFL combine relates to the performance of the player in future NFL games.  We believe that this could be accomplished by comparing NFL combine statistics (height, weight, hand size, 40 yard dash, vertical jump, etc), draft position, to actual NFL career statistics (receptions, receiving yards, TDs, etc) of certain player positions to help understand the relevant indicators of top-tier, NFL talent.
